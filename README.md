### Business requirements

- Background

Imagine a world where the events around you were illuminated and easier to find insight on. IRL was founded with the mission to help people out of isolation. 


- Business opportunity

A more hyperlocal geospatial solution that is highlighted by hyperlocality

- Business objectives

To create an MVP for this summer partnering with 17 Strong in Hamilton, OH to learn about future feature needs for v1.0 of the app.

- Success metrics

Running an MVP that enables us to gather data both quantitatively and qualitatively with super users and inactive users of the app

- Vision statement

You can describe your product vision using the following format:

    For those feeling isolated
    Who wand to know what is going on around them
    The IRL app
    Is a mobile app
    That highlight hyperlocal event options
    Unlike Eventbrite, Facebook Events, and VibeMaps
    My product builds features for the hyperlocal user to know what is going on in the area.

- Monetization model

I think the largest two potentials for monetization at this point are affilate marketing and ads.

- Business risks

Potential for not enough events to make the app worth going back to. People making fake or illicit events.

- Assumptions and dependencies

(TBD) Business assumptions reflect your observations of ways you can achieve desired business objectives. Given the objective to bring in $X in revenue within Z months, your assumption can be that a new app will attract 100 monthly active users who will spend on average $15 a month. Highlight external factors that your mobile app development depends on, such as third-party suppliers, partners, other business projects, industry standards, or legislation. These factors create a dependency on how external variables might affect the timeline and delivery of your app.

### Scope and Limitations

- List of features

-MAP
-CALENDAR

- Scope of subsequent releases

    This section describes features that arenâ€™t so critical to be developed first because of their complexity, high cost, or low profitability. You can implement them in future app releases.

- Limitations and exclusions

    List features that you have to cut from the project scope. You can add them to subsequent releases.
