### Business requirements

- Background

    <Describe the situation that led you to the idea of creating a mobile app, the overall goal(s) for your project, and the improvements you believe it will bring to your business.>


- Business opportunity

    Highlight the strengths and advantages of your app compared to existing solutions on the market. Describe how your mobile app will keep up with market trends and ever-evolving technologies.

- Business objectives

    Summarize what benefits you expect to get from building a mobile app in a quantitative and measurable way. Your objectives must be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound).

- Success metrics

    Determine what indicators will help stakeholders understand that your project has achieved success. For example, for an e-commerce app, to bring in $X in revenue within Z months, a good goal could be getting two cross-sales on 80% of orders.

- Vision statement

You can describe your product vision using the following format:

    For (target users)
    Who (need or want to change something)
    The (your product name)
    Is (a mobile app)
    That (will provide unique valuable functionality, key benefit)
    Unlike (current business model or competitors)
    My product (advantages that differentiate your app from competing apps)

- Monetization model

    From the outset of your project development, define how your mobile app will generate revenue. You can check out possible monetization models for mobile apps in our previous article.

- Business risks

    Think of possible situations that can adversely affect your mobile app development. For example, what will you do if you get too few downloads? You need primarily to estimate the probability of this risk and how it will impact the whole project. Then plan actions to control, mitigate, or eliminate the risk. Involve other stakeholders in the decision-making process.

- Assumptions and dependencies

    Business assumptions reflect your observations of ways you can achieve desired business objectives. Given the objective to bring in $X in revenue within Z months, your assumption can be that a new app will attract 100 monthly active users who will spend on average $15 a month. Highlight external factors that your mobile app development depends on, such as third-party suppliers, partners, other business projects, industry standards, or legislation. These factors create a dependency on how external variables might affect the timeline and delivery of your app.

### Scope and Limitations

- List of features

    Define what features your app must, should, could, and won’t provide based on your business objectives, time and financial resources, and problems with existing business solutions, if any.

- Scope of initial release

    Define what features you should develop first. To help you decide, read our article about nine techniques to prioritize features for a mobile app.

- Scope of subsequent releases

    This section describes features that aren’t so critical to be developed first because of their complexity, high cost, or low profitability. You can implement them in future app releases.

- Limitations and exclusions

    List features that you have to cut from the project scope. You can add them to subsequent releases.

### Business Context

- Key stakeholders

    Create profiles of everyone somehow related to your project: those who take an active part in mobile app development, who depend on its outcome, and who impact its outcome.

- Project priorities

    Agree on features, quality, schedule, budget, and team size. Prioritize the factors that lead to your project’s success and define constraints on project development. Discuss the degree of freedom you can grant your project manager to accomplish tasks that lead to project success within the existing constraints.


- Deployment considerations

    Describe possible improvements you want to make for your mobile application to expand its market share. These can be extra features to reach audiences in other countries or new cloud data storage to make your app more adaptive.
